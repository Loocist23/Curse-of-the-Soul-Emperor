presentation of the game
a simple text based game
with rpg elements
and a story that is going to be the story of my next game
but this time it is going to be a text based game



a litle bit of story:
so one day you woke up and you were in a house that you didn't know
first you thought that you were dreaming but then you realized that you were not
you went outside and you saw a lot of monsters
so you reentered the house and you saw a sword on the table
you took it and you started to search for equipment
you found a broken shield and a rusty helmet
you took them and you went outside again
at first the light was blinding but then you got used to it
you saw a litle girl and you asked her what happened and where you are
she told you 'What happened? You are blind ? or you are deaf ? or you are dumb ?'
you asked her again and she told you that you were in a dungeon
you asked her how you can get out and she told you that you have to kill the boss
you asked her if there is other people in the dungeon and she told you that there is
you asked her where they are and she told you that they are in the middle of the dungeon
thats when you realized that you are in a game
you asked her if she is a NPC and she told you the exact same thing
so you imediately started to search for the other people
